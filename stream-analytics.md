## Window Functions: 

Now, let's go through each type of window function and see how they can be used in real industry scenarios:

1. **Tumbling Window**: A tumbling window divides the data stream into fixed and non-overlapping time segments. Each segment represents a specific period, and data within that segment is processed as a group. For example, if you have a data stream of temperature readings from a factory, you could use a tumbling window to calculate the average temperature every hour. This helps you monitor the temperature trend at regular intervals.

   **Industry Use Case**: Retail stores can use tumbling windows to calculate hourly sales metrics, such as the total number of items sold or revenue generated per hour, to identify peak shopping times.

2. **Hopping Window**: A hopping window is similar to a tumbling window, but it allows windows to overlap. It "hops" over the data stream at regular intervals. This means that a single data point can be included in multiple windows. Using the same factory example, you could have a hopping window that calculates the average temperature every 30 minutes, with each window overlapping the previous one by 15 minutes.

   **Industry Use Case**: Telecommunication companies can utilize hopping windows to analyze call drop rates in overlapping time periods, helping them identify areas with persistent network issues.

3. **Sliding Window**: A sliding window divides the data stream into fixed-size segments, but unlike the hopping window, it moves forward continuously without overlap. It processes new data points and discards old ones as it slides. For instance, you could use a sliding window to calculate the maximum value of a stock price over the last 5 minutes.

   **Industry Use Case**: E-commerce platforms can apply sliding windows to track the click-through rate (CTR) of advertisements in real-time, allowing them to optimize ad placements for better performance.

4. **Session Window**: A session window groups together data within a specified "gap" or period of inactivity. It starts a new window every time there is no data for a defined duration. For example, you might use a session window to analyze user activity on a website, where each session represents the time a user spends actively engaging with the site before being inactive.

   **Industry Use Case**: Streaming platforms can leverage session windows to track user watching behavior, helping to understand how long users are engaged with specific content before taking breaks.

These window functions offer powerful ways to process and analyze streaming data efficiently, enabling businesses to gain real-time insights and make data-driven decisions. By applying these concepts to various industries, companies can improve operations, enhance customer experiences, and optimize business strategies.
