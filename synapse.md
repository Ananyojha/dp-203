## Definition

## Dedicated vs Serverless
1. SV - only external tables
2. ded - Can create and store Tables just like SQl Db + External DB **(Azure Portal -> Left side => SQL Pools => {+})**
3. Azure Synapse Portal => Workspace => SQL DB => you see bth serverless + dedicated........ Left side under mange => see agian
4. PAUSE SQL POOL:
- **(Azure Portal -> Left side => SQL Pools => CLCK ON NAME => PAUSE IT**
  ---------------------------------
1. Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse):

a. Data Warehousing and Analytics: Dedicated SQL Pool is ideal for large-scale data warehousing and analytical workloads. It can handle massive amounts of structured and semi-structured data, providing fast query processing capabilities for complex analytical queries and reporting.

b. Real-Time Data Analytics: Dedicated SQL Pool can be used to perform real-time analytics on streaming data. By integrating with Azure Stream Analytics or Azure Data Factory, organizations can process and analyze data as it arrives, enabling real-time insights and actions.

c. Data Integration and Transformation: Organizations can use Dedicated SQL Pool to integrate and transform data from various sources into a centralized data repository. It allows for complex data processing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to prepare data for analysis.

d. Business Intelligence (BI) and Reporting: Dedicated SQL Pool can serve as a back-end for business intelligence and reporting tools, enabling users to create interactive dashboards and perform ad-hoc data analysis.

e. Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics: By leveraging the power of Dedicated SQL Pool, organizations can build predictive models and perform advanced analytics on large datasets, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

2. Azure Synapse Serverless (formerly Azure Synapse SQL On-Demand):

a. Ad-Hoc Querying: Serverless is suitable for ad-hoc querying and exploratory data analysis. It allows users to query data without the need for provisioning and managing dedicated resources. This is beneficial for scenarios where the data is not accessed continuously.

b. Cost-Effective Data Lake Analytics: Serverless can be used as an economical option for querying data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage. It allows you to access and analyze data in a pay-as-you-go manner, minimizing costs when the data is not queried frequently.

c. Data Exploration and Validation: Serverless can be used to explore and validate data in your data lake before performing more intensive processing or integration tasks.

d. External Data Source Querying: Serverless allows you to query external data sources such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage without the need to load the data into a separate database, simplifying data access and reducing data movement overhead.

e. Supplement to Dedicated SQL Pool: In some cases, Serverless can complement Dedicated SQL Pool by providing on-demand querying capabilities for occasional workloads or additional data sources.

## OPENROWSET - reads the content of the file(s) from a data source
> In easy terms, the OPENROWSET function in Azure Synapse Analytics is like a bridge that allows you to directly access data stored in external sources from your database queries. It's a way to read data from files like CSV or Excel, or even from other databases, without having to first copy that data into your own database.

## external database objects - permanent reference to the external source 

## external database objects vs openrowset 
In easy language, the main difference between external database objects - LONG TERM USE + PERMANENT REFERNCE IN YOUR SYNAPSE
- `OPENROWSET` function in Azure Synapse Analytics -- TEMP / ONE TIME REFERNCE 

External Database Objects:
- External database objects are like references or links to data stored outside of your Synapse database. They allow you to interact with data in external sources as if it were part of your database.
- These objects provide a persistent connection to external data sources, making it easier to access and query data from those sources whenever needed.
- They are suitable for scenarios where you frequently need to work with data from the same external source and want a more structured and optimized approach.

Example Real-Life Use Case:
Imagine you have a data lake in Azure Blob Storage where you store all your historical data. You can create an external database object in your Synapse database that points to this data lake. Now, you can easily query and analyze data from the data lake using standard SQL commands, as if it were just another table in your database. This is helpful when you regularly analyze data from the data lake and want to avoid copying the data into your database repeatedly.

`OPENROWSET` Function:
- The `OPENROWSET` function is like a one-time window to access data from an external source in a query. It allows you to read data from files or databases located outside of your database temporarily, without creating a persistent link.
- It is useful for ad-hoc or one-time data retrieval when you don't need a permanent connection to the external data source.

Example Real-Life Use Case:
Suppose you have received a CSV file containing some important data, and you want to quickly analyze its contents. Instead of first copying the data into your database, you can use the `OPENROWSET` function to directly read the data from the CSV file in your query. This way, you can quickly perform a one-time analysis without permanently storing the data in your database.

In summary, external database objects are more suited for persistent and frequent access to data in external sources, while the `OPENROWSET` function is ideal for temporary and ad-hoc data retrieval without the need for long-term connections.
